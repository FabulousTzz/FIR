# FIR dev

Happy playing with the computer!!!
Wish you could beat the algorithm :D

## For Dev

This is a test of how neural network will do in self-playing and learning the game FIR.  

The architecture for neural network is KERAS (using TensorFlow backend) and the algorithm for learning by self-playing is based on Q-learning (with few modifications)

> Since TensorFlow is not yet available for Python 3.7, this project only supports Python 3.6.*
